- Note:
(1) The code is based on our paper:
    Yuan H, Wu S, Cheng P, An P, and Bao S, Nonlocal Random Walks for Semi-Automatic 2D-to-3D Image Conversion, 
    IEEE Signal Processing Letters, 2015, 22(3): 371-374.
(2) Some code is in p-file format. All the source code are available on NRW.
(4) The code has been tested in MATLAB R2013a running on Windows 7(64bit). 
    
- Usage example:
(1) run demoRw to do semi-automatic 2D-to-3D conversion using RW algorithm.
(2) run demoRwGc to perform semi-automatic 2D-to-3D conversion using hybrid GC and RW algorithm.
(3) run demoRwNonlocal to do semi-automatic 2D-to-3D conversion using our method.
